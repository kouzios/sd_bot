# discord-bot
My discord bot, intended for our senior design group

# How to use the code itself?

0: Have node along with npm. 

1: npm i

3: add auth.json based on copy.auth.json format - the key being the discord auth key

Then you can add it to your discord server via the [developer apps portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) for discord, populating auth.json with the discord auth key provided by that app bot.
